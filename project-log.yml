  goal: Get source dataset
  desc: |
    Located NetFlow data with attack labeling. ZIP called WISENT-CIDDS-001.
    Working with //CIDDS-001-internal-week1.csv. 8,451,520 records. Created to
    reproduce
    an insider atttack(s) from an infected host (internal). (Other datasets for
    external threats.)

  goal: Explore source dataset
  desc: |
    Uploaded CSV to Google Drive, imported into Google BigQuery (new project >
    new dataset > new table). Set BQ header row = 1. Edit schema as JSON text.

  Try new query. Should be smaller w/ 11 fields.
  Will it fit Sheets, cells < 1 M?
